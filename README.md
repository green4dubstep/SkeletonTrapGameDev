The game is rogue-like, similar to undertale, the twist is you play as a Skeleton trying to fend off humans and
you gather equipment to try and take over the humans. In each room you can gather things like bones, teeth,
arms, and other Skeleton pieces to build your fellow skeletons to help you take over the humans. There will
be a total of 5 rooms, each room will contain humans you have to fight off, and items you can gather. In the
5th and final room, you have to fight the final boss, which is named “King”. King is the King of the humans
and the final boss to beat the game.
